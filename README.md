# web-3d-portfolio

Create a 3D interactive website for displaying my project portfolio as a web 3d developer using three.js with react-three-fiber and react-three-drei. I want it to be build on top of next.js and deploy to vercel. It includes 3 pages: Home page with fancy visual glassy effect and SSR in dark theme, About page with long paragraph that easy to read, and Project page to includes all my work portfolio with different media files like png, audio, and video
